I'm Gergely (pronounced [gɛrˈgɛj]), but you can call me Gary. I have been coding for the web for at least 10 years now.

When I came across [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and really dived deep into the framework, I had known it will shortly be the pinnacle of the JavaScript, more precisely the React ecosystem. With its complete toolset for today's frontend requirements, NextJS offers arguably one the best solutions for a modern, performant website.

Another thing I had in mind for this blog was [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). The extended version of Markdown allows developers to not only leverage the widely used language of authoring content, but also to include interactive elements in the form of React components. I think this is a huge win for content creators who don't mind the absence of a WYSIWYG editor and a database. MDX content can be version controlled and written directly in our favorite IDE.

For the posts metadata, I use [frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/#frontmatter), which is included in the MDX toolset. This handy library allows me to include metadata like title, post date or tags right at the top of `.mdx` files.

# Moving on to JavaScript

As many web developers, I also started coding with the [LAMP stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)>), specifically PHP. I have worked on small corporate sites using custom PHP or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), to huge enterprise solutions using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) as an extensible CMS.

Unfortunately, out of plain laziness, I worked with Drupal most of my employed life. A CMS–framework–frankenstein that _many_ people love to hate. But still, it put food on the table. I got really good at it. However, as I got more and more into its depths, there were lots of head-scratching and cursing at its many, many shenanigans. I wanted to move on...

I really loved PHP. In fact I still love it. But the web changed _a lot_ in recent years. Nowadays, all the cool kids code in JavaScript. The language has matured enough to be the de-facto standard for modern web application development. I didn't want to miss the hype-train.

# What this site is about

I'm really excited to code in JavaScript, and this site will mostly feature coding related articles. Heck, maybe even about Drupal too, as there are not many good resources for it on the web. It might help newcomers climbing that learning curve.

Other stuff I plan to post here besides coding:

- bash tricks
- music
- gaming
- any nerdy stuff, basically

**Enjoy!**
